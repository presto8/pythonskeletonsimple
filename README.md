# pythonskeletonsimple

A simple single-file Python boilerplate for writing simple command-line shell
scripts.

Use pythonskeletonsimple when the project uses only modules that are provided with the
standard Python installation. For more complicated projects, consider
[pythonskeleton](https://github.com/presto8/pythonskeleton) instead.
